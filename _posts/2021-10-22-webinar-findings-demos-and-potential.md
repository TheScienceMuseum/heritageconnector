At 14.30–16.30 on 3 December 2021, the [Heritage Connector](https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/project/heritage-connector/) project hosted a free, public webinar to share the findings from the project.

The webinar featured: 

* Technical overview of the project’s approach,
* A set of [demonstrators](https://thesciencemuseum.github.io/heritage-connector-demos/) which have been developed by the project team and through a [hackathon](https://thesciencemuseum.github.io/heritageconnector/post/2021/12/05/Hackathon-Demos/) held with digital agency [Cogapp](https://www.cogapp.com),
* Reflections on the project from a digital humanities and curatorial perspectives.

Recordings of the webinar will be posted on this page shortly.

* Q: are the URLs which you derive from the CSV fed back into the CMS, or do they only live in the knowledge graph?
* Q: are the links typed, i.e. what properties are you specifying? CIDOC CRM?
* Would you mind pasting your questions into the Q&A, to make sure they don't get missed?
* Cool thanks!

* there have been contributions to Wikidata as part of the Wikimedian in Residence project, but not extensively
* So you were using Wikidata Q IDs as persistent identifiers
* <https://cidoc-crm.org/>
* Yes, Wikidata was largely used as a persistent identifier and though WD allow us to find other persistent ID's in other catalogues.
* In the next project we plan to add two major history of science and technology bibliographies into its knowledge graph
* Isis and SHOT bibliographies
