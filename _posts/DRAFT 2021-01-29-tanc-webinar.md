[Book tickets](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/foundation-projects-heritage-connectors-deep-discoveries-tickets-138584262259) 

The [Towards a National Collection](https://www.nationalcollection.org.uk) directorate is pleased to announce the presentation of interim findings from its Foundation Projects.

The second instalment of our Foundation Project series features speakers John Stack (Heritage Connector, The Science Museum) and Lora Angelova (Deep Discoveries, The National Archives).

# Heritage Connector (John Stack)

Project Investigators: Science Museum Group, Victoria & Albert Museum and School of Advanced Study, University of London

Heritage Connector explores three technologies (AI, Linked Open Data & Knowledge Graphs) that together have the potential to provide a step change in access and discoverability, research and public engagement by augmenting traditional catalogue data and associated keyword search through generation of a vast number of interlinked resources and content.

Early findings around the complexities and technical challenges of applying artificial intelligence techniques to cultural heritage collection catalogues will be shared.

# Deep Discoveries (Lora Angelova)

Project Investigators: The National Archives, University of Surrey, Victoria & Albert Museum and Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh
Project Partners: The Gainsborough Weaving Company, The Museum of Domestic Design & Architecture and Sanderson Design Archive

The Deep Discoveries project is carrying out research into the application of computer vision search tools for enhancing the ability of general audiences and specialist researchers to discover visual collections in new and/or more effective ways.

Early findings around search algorithm development, user-centered scenarios in search and discovery, and the front-end design of a prototype web-based search app will be discussed.
