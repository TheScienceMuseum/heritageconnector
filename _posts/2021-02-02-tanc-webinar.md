Webinar date and time: 14:00–15:30 GMT, 22 February 2021

The [Towards a National Collection](https://www.nationalcollection.org.uk) directorate is pleased to announce the presentation of interim findings from its [Foundation Projects](https://www.nationalcollection.org.uk/projects).

The second instalment of our Foundation Project webinar series features speakers [John Stack](https://st-ck.net) (Heritage Connector, Science Museum Group) and Lora Angelova (Deep Discoveries, The National Archives).

## Heritage Connector (John Stack)

Project Investigators: Science Museum Group, Victoria and Albert Museum, and School of Advanced Study, University of London

[Heritage Connector](https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/project/heritage-connector/) explores three technologies (AI, linked open data and knowledge graphs) that together have the potential to provide a step change in access and discoverability, research and public engagement by augmenting traditional catalogue data and associated keyword search through generation of a vast number of interlinked resources and content.

Early findings around the complexities and technical challenges of applying artificial intelligence techniques to cultural heritage collection catalogues will be shared.

## Deep Discoveries (Lora Angelova)

Project Investigators: The National Archives, University of Surrey, Victoria and Albert Museum, and Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh
Project Partners: The Gainsborough Weaving Company, The Museum of Domestic Design and Architecture, and Sanderson Design Archive

The [Deep Discoveries](https://tanc-ahrc.github.io/DeepDiscoveries/) project is carrying out research into the application of computer vision search tools for enhancing the ability of general audiences and specialist researchers to discover visual collections in new and/or more effective ways.

Early findings around search algorithm development, user-centered scenarios in search and discovery, and the front-end design of a prototype web-based search app will be discussed.
