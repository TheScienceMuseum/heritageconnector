The [Heritage Connector](https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/project/heritage-connector/) project developed a [suite of demonstrators](http://heritageconnector.sciencemuseum.org.uk) which allow exploration of the [data](https://thesciencemuseum.github.io/heritageconnector/post/2021/12/03/Heritage-Connector-Dataset/) generated through the project.

Additional demonstrators were created through a [hackathon](https://thesciencemuseum.github.io/heritageconnector/post/2021/12/05/Hackathon-Demos/) in November 2021.
